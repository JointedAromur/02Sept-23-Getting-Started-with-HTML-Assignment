    <h1>Why do Atoms Explode when they are Split?</h1>

    <!--This is a paragraph tag, it is use to define a block of text-->
    <p>
      Atoms of radioactive elements can split. According to Albert Einstein,
      mass and energy are interchangeable under certain circumstances. When
      atoms split, the process is called nuclear fission. In this case, a small
      amount of mass is converted into energy. Thus the energy released cannot
      do much damage. However, several subatomic particles called neutrons are
      also emitted during this process. Each neutron will hit a radioactive
      element releasing more neutrons in the process. This causes a chain
      reaction and creates a large amount of energy. This energy is converted
      into heat which expands uncontrollably causing an explosion. Hence, atoms
      do not literally explode. They generate energy that can cause explosions.

      Yesterday I saw a film titled Macbeth. Its story elements are interesting.
      The film hero, Macbeth, assassinates Duncan and ascends to the throne of
      Scotland. But he is dissatisfied. He finds himself in a dangerous
      situation. He executes those he suspects of plotting against him.<br />
      Eventually, some of the lords revolted and dethroned him and killed him.
      The message it conveys is that excessive ambition destroys a man. The
      actor and actress who played Macbeth and Lady Macbeth had exceptional
      performances, which significantly increased the film impact.
